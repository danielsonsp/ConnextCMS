# ConnextCMS
[ConnextCMS.com](http://connextcms.com) is a front end extension for KeystoneJS. It uses the Backbone.js framework to structure the code and Require.js to modularize it. The client side code interacts with KeystoneJS via a REST API, allowing development and debugging of your CMS to take place in the browser. The main features include:
* Local File and Image Hosting
* Automatic Image Resizing
* Email routing with Nodemailer
* Debugging & Development in the Browser
* JavaScript Homogeneity: JavaScript is the only programming language running the website.

There are two ways to install ConnextCMS.  The easy way is to [clone the demo droplet](http://connextcms.com/page/clone-your-own). The second is to build from source. 

### Clone the Demo
ConnextCMS is designed to run on a [Digital Ocean Droplet](https://m.do.co/c/8f47a23b91ce) VPS. A snapshot has been created that you can clone and spin up in a few minutes with all software and dependencies installed. Visit [ConnextCMS.com](http://connextcms.com) and [fill out this form](http://connextcms.com/page/clone-your-own). 

### Build from Source
Complete instructions for building from source are still in the process of being written, but the general outline is as follows:
 1. Install [KeystoneJS](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone) and get it operational. 
 2. Clone this repository.
 3. Run the _copy-keystone_ and _merge-connextcms-keystone_ scripts.

More details can be found in [the documentation](https://github.com/skagitpublishing/ConnextCMS/wiki/Installation).

## Documentation and Support
The easiest way to get up to speed on installing and using ConnextCMS is to watch the series of [instructional videos](http://connextcms.com/page/videos) that have been created. It is also strongly recommended that you familiarize yourself with the [KeystoneJS documentation](keystonejs.com/docs/). ConnextCMS is built using the Backbone.js and Require.js frameworks. [Developing Backbone.js Applications](https://addyosmani.com/backbone-fundamentals/) is a well written, free, open source book for learning about how to use these two frameworks.
